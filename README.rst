THis is a Python tool to assist in manipulating equations needed to derive the fluid flow governing equations from basic principles to finite difference implementation.

This project implements an old program i wrote in Fortran around 1976. It know no math but it does know how to manipulate equations using common operations.

The math grammar this tool recognizes if defineg in a Pepeg parser generator grammar file. The output is LaTeX code suitable for including in documentation or display in a Jupyter Notebook.
